We argue that part of the challenge is a lack of first principles mechanisms one can use to design scalable and verifiable policies. We present Charon, a market-based scheme for large scale cloud applications. Charon relies on tokens to negotiate the acquisition of compute resources. Charon decouple the mechanisms used to generate and value tokens, and introduces a novel price propagation technique that scales well to large scale cloud applications. We study how one can build, using Charon's primitives, a concrete overload control policy and its performance compared to a policy built without Charon.}}

\item{\cventry{}{Aug. 2018 - Jan. 2019}{Does Centralized Corruption Reduce Bribes?}{}{}{\vspace{3pt}
	Employed Stochastic Frontier Analysis to evaluate the impact of centralized bureaucracy on corruption levels. Controlled for heteroskedasticity, spatial autocorrelation, and robustness. Concluded that while centralized governance does not reduce the base level of bribery (the bribe frontier), it does significantly lower overall bribe amounts by decreasing inefficiencies in bribe transactions.
		 %Accounted for heteroskedasticity, spatial autocorrelation, and robustness to study the corruption of centralized bureaucracy with Stochastic Frontier Analysis. Found that centralized bureaucracy does not lower corruption by reducing minimum bribes, i.e., the bribe frontier, but does lower the bribes by reducing the bribe inefficiency. 
%It means that once the entrepreneurs pay bribes efficiently, a more centralized bureaucratic structure will not help reduce their bribes anymore.
