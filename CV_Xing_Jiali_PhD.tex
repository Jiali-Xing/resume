I work well as part of the team, contributing in group discussions and taking initiative to set myself tasks when the next stage of the project is not clear.

It required excellent planning and organisational skills, and the ability to teach myself an entirely new and complex subject. The project was a success, with the system being able to localise a radioactive source down to $ 3 cm$ within a $ 600 m^3$ sensor array. This project has been suggested for publication by my supervisor.}}

Lee}{Charon: A Framework for Microservice Overload Control}{}{}{\vspace{3pt} Modern cloud applications are increasingly large and complex, designing an efficient overload control scheme that scales well is tedious. We argue that part of the challenge is a lack of first principles mechanisms one can use to design scalable and verifiable policies. We present Charon, a market-based scheme for large scale cloud applications. Charon relies on tokens to negotiate the acquisition of compute resources. Charon decouple the mechanisms used to generate and value tokens, and introduces a novel price propagation technique that scales well to large scale cloud applications. We study how one can build, using Charon's primitives, a concrete overload control policy and its performance compared to a policy built without Charon.}}

The framework operationalizes the nested constant elasticity of substitution utility function and develops an allocation procedure that guarantees sharing incentives and Pareto efficiency. We draw parameters from gem5 experiments and then compare our algorithm against DRF.}}

It means that once the entrepreneurs pay bribes efficiently, a more centralized bureaucratic structure will not help reduce their bribes anymore.}}
