	abstract = {In this paper, we present Talaria, a novel permissioned blockchain simulator that supports numerous protocols and use cases, most notably in supply chain management. Talaria extends the capability of {BlockSim}, an existing blockchain simulator, to include permissioned blockchains and serves as a foundation for further private blockchain assessment. Talaria is designed with both practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance ({pBFT}) and simplified version of Proof-of-Authority consensus protocols, but can be revised to include other permissioned protocols within its modular framework. Moreover, Talaria is able to simulate different types of malicious authorities and a variable daily transaction load at each node. In using Talaria, business practitioners and policy planners have an opportunity to measure, evaluate, and adapt a range of blockchain solutions for commercial operations.},
